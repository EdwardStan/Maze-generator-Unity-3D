# Maze-generator-Unity-3D

This is a random generated prefect maze, made with recursive backtracking algorithm, that let you chose the number of rows and columns you want to generate.

Try this aplication by downloading the "Maze generator Windows.zip" where you can find the final build for windows, and then start Maze Generator.exe.
You can also try it by using the link https://simmer.io/@StanEdward/~4bba9d7a-cd94-ab71-255f-529349a9bc60/edit to test in in browser as a WebGL build.
Keep in mind the fact that on browser, big mazes take longer to generate.
